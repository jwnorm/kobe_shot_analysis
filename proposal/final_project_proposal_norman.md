Advanced Business Analytics â€“ Final Project Proposal

Project Title
-------------
Kobe Bryant Shot Selection

Type of Final Project
---------------------
Kaggle competition

Executive Summary of the Proposed Project
-----------------------------------------

The competition is relatively straightforward. There is a log of all of Kobe
Bryant's shots throughout his career with many descriptive statistics,
including shot type, shot distance, time remaining, etc. There are 5,000 
missing shots in the log that must be predicted using some form of
modelling.

Although I may be more comfortable in R, I would like to use Python for this 
challenge. I believe this will require some scripting, and a fully-functional
programming language would be more suited for that.

Additionally, I will submit a Jupyter Notebook detailing the steps I went through
to complete my final submission for the project.

Data Needs and Sources
-----------------------
As this is a Kaggle competition, the data is already provided. There will no doubt
be some data preparation, such as combining columns, or creating entirely new ones.
Some data will also be irrelevant, resulting in the deletion of columns.

Anticipated Challenges
----------------------
The competition page suggests that data leakage will be a problem. Therefore, each
shot could have its own training set, resulting in 5,000 different models! This 
will likely require scripting and more advanced techniques than the basic predictive 
modelling covered in class.

Personal Learning Objectives
----------------------------
This is going to be a challenge. I am going to use Python because it is something I 
am not very comfortable with. I would like to push myself to not only understand the
material, but to apply it to a real scenario. Predicting Kobe Bryant's made shots is
not exactly something I am likely to encounter in the business world, but it is a
fun topic that I will really enjoy working with. This will push me to achieve the
best possible results and learn new, challenging concepts in Python, such as random
forests.
